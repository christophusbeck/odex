The main objective of the project is to develop an experimental framework for studying the detection and generation of outlying data on high dimensional data sets. We build an experimental framework as a web application. The application applies different detection algorithms to detect outliers in an arbitrary selection of subspaces and datasets, and then, gather the results of the run. The application records the results of all runs. If the user provides a ground truth file, it compares the detected data objects with a ground truth label and output the accuracy of the final model.
